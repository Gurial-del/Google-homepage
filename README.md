# Google-homepage
My first CSS practice: a replica of the Google homepage.

--- 

# Google Homepage Clone 
This project is my first formal web layout practice, where the main objective was to replicate the structure and style of the Google homepage. 

### Technologies Used ðŸ’»

* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the content.
* **CSS3:** For styling, positioning, and visual design. Key concepts used include:
    * Flexbox for aligning elements.
    * Class and ID selectors.
    * The box model.

 ### P.S.
 Images icons are not the best. 
 href not working.
